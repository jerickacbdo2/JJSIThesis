             <p class="pt-4"> The Jasper Jean Group was established by Alfonso Costes in 1997.  Prior to entering the bus transportation fray, Mr. Costes, an enterprising businessman, ventured into tricycle operations and eventually transitioned to jeepney operations.  And finally, in 1997, he started his bus transportation business.  Operations humbly started with one (1) unit used Japanese bus / Japayuki under the “kabit-system”.  In 2000, fleet grew to four (4) units used-Japanese / Japayuki buses, traversing the Baclaran to Monument. </p>   
 
            <p>In 2001, the founder’s nephew, Edwin P. Costes, who obtained his Master’s In Business Management degree at the Asian Institute of Management, took over as the company’s president.   Part of his agenda was to formalize the operations.  On 23 January 2002, the company was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as Jasper Jean Services Incorporated (JJSI).  It was named after Alfonso’s youngest child, Jasper Jean.  It started to operate under the modified franchise routes of Navotas to Pala-pala Dasmarinas in Cavite, and vice-versa, via EDSA Ayala, Coastal Road and Aguinaldo Hi-way.  The company acquired more franchise routes of distressed and bankrupt operators plying the Lawton to Cavite City route.</p>
